# Finding hard to retain your customers? Then Stop Losing your Customers, Predict Churn for better retention of your Business

Sure, here's an introduction:

Customer churn can be a significant problem for businesses. When customers stop doing business with a company, it can lead to lost revenue and decreased profitability. Additionally, the cost of acquiring new customers to replace lost ones can be high. Furthermore, high churn rates can also be an indicator of underlying issues with a company's products, services, or customer experience.

To combat customer churn, companies can implement strategies such as improving customer service, enhancing the customer experience, providing incentives for customers to remain loyal, and identifying at-risk customers early to intervene before they churn. One effective approach to identifying at-risk customers is through customer churn prediction modeling, which uses data and machine learning algorithms to predict which customers are likely to churn and take proactive steps to retain them.

This project throws light on how to attck a problem as such mainly in the banking sector, what machine learning tools and algorithms would we have to use to better understand which users are likely to churn.
